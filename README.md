# A Simple, Jitted PPO Implementation in Jax. 

The code is pretty much exactly the same as Chris Lu's excellent implementation in [PureJAXRL](https://github.com/luchris429/purejaxrl/tree/main).

What I've added:

- Logging with W&B
- Checkpointing / loading agents
- An interface to adjust environment parameters
- An evaluation notebook in which you can load agents, run them, and make gifs
